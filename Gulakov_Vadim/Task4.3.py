"""Task 4.3 File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format. This file contains the studentâ€™s names,
age and average mark. 1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
```python def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5): pass

print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))
['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']
```

2) Implement a function which receives the file path with srudents info and writes CSV student information to the
new file in descending order of age. Result: ``` student name,age,average mark Verdell Crawford,30,8.86 Brenda
Silva,30,7.53 ... Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88 Raymond Soileau,18,7.27 ```
